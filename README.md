# Car-Rental-System-using-C
This Car Rental System in C lets users add, rent, return, and view available cars. It stores car details in a struct array and ensures a car can't be rented twice without return. The menu-driven program is great for learning structs, arrays, and I/O in C.
The system keeps track of cars using a struct and stores details such as the model, license plate, daily rental rate, and rental status in an array.

Features:
Add Car – Register new cars with their details.

Rent Car – Rent a car by entering its license plate.

Return Car – Return a rented car.

Display Available Cars – View all cars that are currently available for rent.

Exit – Quit the program.

The program runs in a menu-driven loop, allowing users to interact with the system efficiently. It ensures that a car cannot be rented twice without being returned first. This project is ideal for beginners learning about structs, arrays, functions, and basic input/output handling in C.
